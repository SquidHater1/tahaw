Team 42 Final Project:
This website is the combination of a clicker game and a button holding game.
On the homepage, the rankings for both games are displayed and there are 
links to both games. The title of the site is a link back to the main page.
On each game page, there are instructions, the game button, and the rankings 
for the game. When the button is clicked the game starts. When the game ends,
a modal apears for the player to input their score for the rankings. The 
rankings are displayed on the server side. The authors are listed at the 
bottom of each page.
